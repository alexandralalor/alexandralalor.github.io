Welcome to my website! My name is Alexandra Lalor, I'm a fire ecologist and wildland firefighter with research experience in forests across the United States. I'm interested in the ways fire shapes our ecosystemsâ€”past, present, and future.

Fire is both an ecological and political force. Climate change and fire suppression have drastically altered fire behavior, impacting the future of forested landscapes. We must learn to live in relationship with fire, and continue to widely adopt prescribed burns with the goal of ecological and community resilience.

Aside from my research interests, I'm also an avid backpacker and ceramicist. Thanks for visiting my site!
