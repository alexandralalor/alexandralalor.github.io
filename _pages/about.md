Welcome to my website! My name is Alexandra Lalor, and I am a fire ecologist and wildland firefighter with research experience in forests across the Western US. I'm interested in the ways fire shape our ecosystems, past present and future. Fire is both an ecological and political force. Climate change and fire suppression have drastically altered fire behavior, impacting the future of forested landscapes. We must learn to live in relationship with fire, and continue to widely adopt prescribed burns with the goal of ecological and community resilience. I believe the way forward is to center indigenous-led fire practices, community involvement in local burns, and science-based adaptive mangement.

Aside from my research interests, I'm also an avid backpacker and ceramicist. Thanks for visiting my site!
