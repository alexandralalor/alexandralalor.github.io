# Collaborative Research

### [Roots for Resilience (R4R)](https://datascience.arizona.edu/r4r)

Roots for Resilience is a cross-disciplinary program which develops programmatic capabilities to intigrate data science tools and computational infrastructure into environmental sciences. As an R4R fellow, I've been trained in open, reproducible science and collaborative data science exploration. I was able to further my research by using High Performance Computing to analyze color change in tree seedlings over time, as it relates to tree mortality during drought. You can watch a demonstration of my color research [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NEY4lEk8jLr8HUqctRIV1gWWjdfkqzBv/view?usp=sharing).

### [University Climate Change Coalition (UC3)](https://secondnature.org/initiative/uc3-coalition/)

The University Climate Change Coalition is a program focused on collaborative approaches to problem solving, aimed at engaging university students and surrounding communities in developing solutions related to climate action. It's a program particularly focused on partnership building, science communication, and experiential learning. As a UC3 fellow, I worked in collaboration with the Sky Island Alliance to develop a storymap highlighting threats to culturally and ecologically important water sources along borderland regions.
