I'm drawn to work with projects which bolster community relationships, mentorships in science, and science practice which is socially just and equitable.

> ## [University Climate Change Coalition (UC3)](https://secondnature.org/initiative/uc3-coalition/)
>
>The University Climate Change Coalition is a program focused on collaborative approaches to problem solving, aimed at engaging university students and surrounding communities in developing solutions related to climate action. It's a program particularly focused on partnership building, science communication, and experiential learning. As a UC3 fellow, I worked in collaboration with the Sky Island Alliance to develop a storymap highlighting threats to culturally and ecologically important water sources along borderland regions. Please take a look!

> ## [Roots for Resilience (R4R)](https://datascience.arizona.edu/r4r)
>
> Roots for Resilience is a cross-disciplinary program which develops programmatic capabilities to integrate data science tools and computational infrastructure into environmental sciences. As an R4R fellow, I've been trained in open science, [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and [CARE](https://www.gida-global.org/care) data science principles, and collaborative data science exploration. I was able to further my research by using High Performance Computing to analyze color change in tree seedlings over time, as it relates to tree mortality during drought. You can watch a demonstration of my color research [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NEY4lEk8jLr8HUqctRIV1gWWjdfkqzBv/view?usp=sharing).

# Mentorship

I believe mentorship is a key way to support future scientists from underrepresented backgrounds to gain a foothold in the science world. I've participated as both a mentee and mentor in several organizational mentorship programs, and have also found informal mentorship from peers, supervisors, and colleagues. If you would like guidance in navigating research positions, and are interested in my background (early-career scientist positions, graduate education, federal jobs, ecology research, wildland firefighting, etc.), feel free to contact me. Below are some examples or organizational mentorships I've participated in.

> [Association for Fire Ecology (AFE)](https://fireecology.org/mentoring)
>
> [Women in Science and Engineering (WISE)](https://wise.arizona.edu/mentorship), University of Arizona, Tucson
>
> [Student Environmental Resource Center (SERC)](https://serc.berkeley.edu/enviromentorship/), University of California, Berkeley

# Book Club

Book clubs are a great way to keep reading with peers! Inspired by conversations started by *Braiding Sweetgrass*, we've read a number of though-provoking books, listed below.

> Braiding Sweetgrass,
Algorithms To Live By,
How Nonviolence Protects the State,
On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous,
The Anatomy of Dependence,
The Revolution Will Not Be Funded,
Fierce Femmes and Notorious Liars,
In the Dream House,
The Body Keeps the Score,
The Disordered Cosmos, 
and
Pachinko

# Resources

I've learned so much from other groups which practice science activism for equitable futures. Here are some examples of wonderful organizations to follow.

> [Free Radicals](https://freerads.org/mission/)
> 
> [Science for the People](https://scienceforthepeople.org/)
> 
> [500 Women Scientists](https://500womenscientists.org/)
> 
> [Firefighters United for Safety, Ethics, and Ecology](https://fusee.org/)
