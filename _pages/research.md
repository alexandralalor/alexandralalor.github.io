# Past Research:

## Master of Science in Natural Resources Studies
### School of Natural Resources and the Environment, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ


## Assistant Lead Fire Effects Monitor
### Grand Canyon National Park, North Rim, AZ
> Vegetation and fuels monitoring in the field reading a variety of permanent and temporary plots in relation to managed fire history. Fieldwork includes protocols for measuring herb cover, shrub abundance, tree size and density, fuel loading, and burn severity.

## Fire Effects Monitor
### North Cascades National Park, Marblemount, WA
> This position combines fire effects monitoring fieldwork with curation of tree wedges and tree cores. Fieldwork consists of collecting forest data (tree and understory vegetation characteristics) to monitor the effectiveness of prescribed fire treatments. Curation tasks include dendrochronology (dating tree specimens), and curation of botanical specimens collected for a fire history study.

## Luquillo Long-Term Ecological Research Intern
### El Verde Field Station, El Yunque National Forest, RÃ­o Grande, PR
> We carried out tropical field work at the El Verde Field Station in the El Yunque National Forest in Puerto Rico. We worked on a variety of projects, including canopy and plot photos, soil and litter processing, vegetation surveys, animal surveys (frogs and lizards) and coarse woody debris measurements.

## Dendrochronology Research Intern
### [USGS New Mexico Landscapes Field Station](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/fort-collins-science-center/science/new-mexico-landscapes-field-station), Bandelier National Monument, Los Alamos, NM
> We worked with long-term monitoring, tree-rings, field studies, and remote sensing data to research climate and land-use-history driven changes to the ecological systems of the mountains of northern New Mexico. We used dendrochronolgy to study fire history in the Jemez and southern Sangre de Cristo Mountains as well as long-term ecological monitoring in and adjacent to Bandelier National Monument.
