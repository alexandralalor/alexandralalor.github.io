# Current Research:

## Lead Biological Science Technician
### [USGS Western Ecological Research Center](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/werc), Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Parks, Three Rivers, CA
> I'm excited to work this summer at Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Parks, studying tree regeneration among giant Sequoias!

## Master of Science in Natural Resources Studies
### School of Natural Resources and the Environment, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ
> I've graduated in December of 2022 as an M.S. in Natural Resources Studies, and an emphasis in Fire Ecology. My research is currently in review with the journal Frontiers in Forests and Global Change.

# Past Research:

## Assistant Lead Fire Effects Monitor
### Grand Canyon National Park, North Rim, AZ
> Vegetation and fuels monitoring in the field reading a variety of permanent and temporary plots in relation to managed fire history. Fieldwork includes protocols for measuring herb cover, shrub abundance, tree size and density, fuel loading, and burn severity.

## Fire Effects Monitor
### North Cascades National Park, Marblemount, WA
> This position combines fire effects monitoring fieldwork with curation of tree wedges and tree cores. Fieldwork consists of collecting forest data (tree and understory vegetation characteristics) to monitor the effectiveness of prescribed fire treatments. Curation tasks include dendrochronology (dating tree specimens), and curation of botanical specimens collected for a fire history study.

## Luquillo Long-Term Ecological Research Intern
### El Verde Field Station, El Yunque National Forest, Río Grande, PR
> During the winter of 2018, I joined the El Verde Field Station in Puerto Rico to study forest dynamics post-hurricane María. We worked on a variety of projects, including canopy and plot photos, soil and litter processing, vegetation surveys, and coarse woody debris measurements.

## Dendrochronology Research Intern
### [USGS New Mexico Landscapes Field Station](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/fort-collins-science-center/science/new-mexico-landscapes-field-station), Bandelier National Monument, Los Alamos, NM
> I spent a year researching with the Dendroecology Lab at the New Mexico Landscapes Field Station, a USGS research team working in collaboration with Bandelier National Monument. Here I studied fire history in the Jemez and Sangre de Cristo Mountains using dendrochronology techniques. Through this position I learned to identify fire scarred trees in the field, take samples of tree cores, and cross date tree rings to determine fire years. I also assisted with ecological monitoring projects at Bandelier National Monument, including demography plots, dendroband measurements, vegetation transects, and fire effects forest plots.

## Bachelor of Science in Environmental Sciences
### College of Natural Resouces, University of California, Berkeley, CA
> My [senior thesis](https://alexandralalor.github.io/files/Lalor_UC-Thesis.pdf) at UC Berkeley focused on grazing effects on plant diversity at Point Reyes National Seashore using multiple spatial scales. At a fine-scale, I looked at species diversity of forbs and grasses in both grazed and ungrazed portions of the land, at either side of fenced grazing allotments. At a broad-scale, I anlayzed changes in shrubland and grassland using GIS vegetation classification maps from aerial images taken in the 1940s, 1960s, and 1990s. Overall, I found that grazing did not alter species diversity significantly, but there had been a large scale shift from grassland to shrubland over time, which may have corresponded with shifting land ownership in the region.
