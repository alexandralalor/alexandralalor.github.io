# Current Research:

## Lead Biological Science Technician
### [USGS Western Ecological Research Center](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/werc), Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Parks, Three Rivers, CA
> I'm excited to work this summer at Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Parks! As a crew lead, I'll bring researchers into backcountry field sites to collect fuel data in recently burned and unburned Sequoia groves. We'll also be looking at forest regeneration and seedling abundance, to see how these landscapes are recovering from recent fires.

## Master of Science in Natural Resources Studies
### School of Natural Resources and the Environment, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ
> I graduated in December of 2022 as an M.S. in Natural Resources Studies, and an emphasis in Fire Ecology. My research is currently in review with the journal Frontiers in Forests and Global Change.
>  
> I implemented a controlled experiment to test the tolerances of tree seedlings to both droughts and heatwaves, using five tree species that span a montane elevational gradient in the southwestern United States. I found strong species differences in drought tolerance. Lower elevation species that grow in warmer ambient conditions died earlier (ponderosa pine in 10 weeks) than did higher elevation species from cooler ambient conditions (limber pine in 30 weeks). I also found that heatwave exposure had a minor effect on tree mortality, which was most pronounced among higher elevation species (limber pine died 2.7 weeks earlier). This study suggests that droughts will play a leading role in juvenile tree mortality and will most directly impact species at warmer climate thresholds. These drought tolerances could shift forest species compostion across a landscape as droughts become more frequent and severe with climate change.

# Past Research:

## Assistant Lead Fire Effects Monitor
### Grand Canyon National Park, North Rim, AZ
> I joined the Fire Effects Monitoring crew at Grand Canyon National Park in 2020, and fell in love with it! The Fire Effects (FX) crew is responsible for monitoring vegetation change following prescribed burns and wildfires using long-term ecological plots. We collect forest data such as plot photos, tree growth, shrub abundance, plant species composition, fuel loading, and seedling counts. We also serve as wildland firefighters, with a particular focus on monitoring fire activity during prescribed burns. In 2021 I joined the FX crew as an Assistant Lead Monitor and took on responsibilites with program management, organizing field work, and data analysis. The depth of fire-related ecological data that this program maintains inspired me to return to graduate school to learn about fire ecology research.

## Fire Effects Monitor
### North Cascades National Park, Marblemount, WA
> As a Scientist-in-Parks intern, I curated tree ring samples for a [fire history study](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2652001548?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true) using dendrochronology. I also worked with the Fire Effects field crew, responsible for collecting forest vegetation data to monitor the effectiveness of prescribed fire treatments. During this time I became a qualified Wildland Firefighter and assisted in prescribed burn operations. I also worked with communication center radio dispatching and Search and Rescue operations within the park.

## Luquillo Long-Term Ecological Research Intern
### El Verde Field Station, El Yunque National Forest, Río Grande, PR
> During the winter of 2018, I joined the El Verde Field Station in Puerto Rico to study forest dynamics post-hurricane María. We worked on a variety of forestry projects, including canopy and plot photos, soil and litter processing, vegetation surveys, and coarse woody debris measurements.

## Dendrochronology Research Intern
### [USGS New Mexico Landscapes Field Station](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/fort-collins-science-center/science/new-mexico-landscapes-field-station), Bandelier National Monument, Los Alamos, NM
> I spent a year researching with the Dendroecology Lab at the New Mexico Landscapes Field Station, a USGS research team working in collaboration with Bandelier National Monument. Here I studied fire history in the Jemez and Sangre de Cristo Mountains using dendrochronology techniques. Through this position I learned to identify fire scarred trees in the field, take samples of tree cores, and cross date tree rings to determine fire years. I also assisted with ecological monitoring projects at Bandelier National Monument, including demography plots, dendroband measurements, vegetation transects, and fire effects forest plots.

## Bachelor of Science in Environmental Sciences
### College of Natural Resouces, University of California, Berkeley, CA
> My [senior thesis](https://alexandralalor.github.io/files/Lalor_UC-Thesis.pdf) at UC Berkeley focused on grazing effects on plant diversity at Point Reyes National Seashore using multiple spatial scales. At a fine-scale, I looked at species diversity of forbs and grasses in both grazed and ungrazed portions of the land, at either side of fenced grazing allotments. At a broad-scale, I anlayzed changes in shrubland and grassland using GIS vegetation classification maps from aerial images taken in the 1940s, 1960s, and 1990s. Overall, I found that grazing did not alter species diversity significantly, but there had been a large scale shift from grassland to shrubland over time, which may have corresponded with shifting land ownership in the region.
